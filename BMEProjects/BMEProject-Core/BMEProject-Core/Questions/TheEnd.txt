00:13 
The happy moments become pictures 
00:21 
They are compiled into our own book 
00:29 
The story full of each page 
00:38 
I hope it's not gonna end forever 
00:46 
But in the end 
00:52 
Our happiness is not limitless 
01:00 
We should write our ending 
01:13 
Don't write the end 
01:20 
Put the pen down and look at me my love 
01:29 
If you put a period and close the book 
01:36 
Forever 
01:42 
There'll be no next chapter 
02:09 
The daunting moments on any pages I turn 
02:18 
How can I end this? 
02:26 
It happened without notice 
02:32 
Suddenly it became a dark tragedy 
02:40 
"Happily ever after’s" just a dream 
02:49 
The common word you'll write down 
03:00 
Don't write the end 
03:08 
Put the pen down and look at me my love 
03:16 
If you put a period and close the book 
03:23 
Forever 
03:32 
Don't write the end 
03:39 
I want to stop you anyway 
03:48 
Now I know I can't avoid it 
03:56 
Bye 
04:05 
In the end, we're “The End”
